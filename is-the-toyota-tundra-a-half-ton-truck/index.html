This is an intriguing truck as it offers more hauling and towing power that a typical half-ton pickup but without large size and hard ride of heavy duty trucks. It would usually be considered a generously built example of a half-ton pickup in traditional US parlance even though its rated payload is three-quarters of a ton.
