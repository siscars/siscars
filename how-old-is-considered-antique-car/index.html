<p>Answer 1 of 6. Like the classic it is expected to be maintained or restored to original specs whenever possible. The definition of classic car is actually quite similar to that of antique cars. Car collector organizations typically define classic car based on age between 1915 and 1948 for example and special. For instance antique car registration documents are available for vehicles that were manufactured prior to 1981. However some states consider anything made after the end of the Forties a Classic and anything from 1949 back to be an Antique.
