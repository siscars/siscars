<p>We live on a dead end road and there is barely enough space for one-car-per-house yet most people down here have two cars and the student houses can have three or four cars.

My next door neighbor frequently parks more than 2-6 cars in their driveway the cul-de-sac and now one car is frequently parking in front of my home on the curb of my property line. Neighbors parking in front of my house does bug me especially if they can easily park in front of ther own house but choose not to do so. Moreover unless it is a public easement your neighbor has no right to park on your property. A spokesman said.
