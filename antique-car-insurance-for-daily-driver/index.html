<p>If your insurance company is REALLY saying they dont want any classic car business ever then Id switch to a mainline company that will accommodate your new AND old cars. Older cars also tend to have inferior entertainment and navigation systems if they have any navigation at all. As for the classic car insurers yes you must have a garage you must have another car to drive and you must limit your miles to under 2500 a year for club events tours and exercise perhaps thats a loop hole.
