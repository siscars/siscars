<p>I define vintage as 20-40 years old and antique as older than 40 years oldbut clearly it is item specific eg radios cars etc. To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age. As examples this age is 20 years in the US. States may also have their own rules to define. This interpretation takes us back to 1987 when the Ford Sierra the Vauxhall Cavalier and the Austin Metro were popular. State of Virginia 30 years in the Australian state of Queensland 30 years in Sweden and Brazil and 35 years in Singapore. 1948 Alfa Romeo 6c 2500 Super Sport Coupe Classic Car Sales Super Sport Cars Classic Cars.</p>

<p>But as with many subjects in the motoring world not everyone can agree on a single definition. Any car 35 years old would be considered an antique. Usually the magic number for cars to reach this designation is 25 years. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. KSNW It may be difficult to believe but you may have an antique car sitting in your driveway. But determining whether you have a vintage or classic car can sometimes be confusing.
