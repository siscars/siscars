<p>Safety is usually not on the list of vintage car advantages. So one of the easiest things a person can do to improve safety is to add seat belts. As a seat belt manufacturer we can make seatbelts to fit old Chevys Fords Mopar British Imports Porches and many many more. Since January 1 1968 vehicle manufacturers have been required to install lap belt anchorages for each front and rear seating position and upper torso belt anchorages at each forward facing outboard seating position. Trace the straps from the original seat belt back to the anchors that attach the belt to the frame of the car. That just plain wont work. A Guide To Seat Belt Law For Classic Cars.</p>

<p>Back in 1963 thanks to the introduction of the seat belt in North America buckle up became synonymous with getting into cars and driving off.

Ensure that you have clean and properly tapped screw threads as well as clear holes through the vehicles carpeting. For more information contact us.
