<p>Oil is the lifeblood of any engine so choosing the right oil for your classic car is essential. This enables the 5w20 motor oil to reach engine parts quicker and create less drag that reduces fuel economy. For example motor oil displaying 20w50 simply told us that the oil performed like a 20w single grade when cold and a 50w single grade when hot. Some manufacturers now offer synthetic oil that includes high amounts of zinc as an additive. Engines that run low oil temps require. To determine the correct viscosity for an application you need to know the operating temperature of the oil in that application. Classic Car Oil Halfords Ie.</p>

<p>Engines that run low oil temps require. I am using a 5W-40 in my 1930 Dodge 8. Generally synthetic oils with high zinc packages exceed the standards needed for classic car and vintage cars no matter how you use the car. The numbers are commonly assigned in ranges of 5 10 20 30 40 and 50. Not all of us know what engine oil in our engines is for. Startup is when most wear occurs so a lower viscosity better enables the oil pump to get oil around the engine quickly.

<p>Oil gets thinner as it gets hotter. The first part of the code is the cold temperature grade and the second part is the high temperature grade. The more you know about your car and the era in which it was built the easier it will be to choose the right oil. The second number refers to the viscosity when the oil is hot. Some manufacturers now offer synthetic oil that includes high amounts of zinc as an additive. A Texaco oil expert advised me to use 20W-50 in my Hupmobile 1929 and 10w-40 in my other prewar cars.
