<p>Antique vehicle registration is open to anything older than 25 years but the restrictions are well defined. Texas requires state-registered vehicles to pass an annual inspection to ensure compliance with safety standards. What will an inspection entail on a classic car here. A former military vehicle that does not meet this requirement may only be registered as an Antique Vehicle or Classic Auto. Antique cars are exempt from Auto Insurance and Annual inspections. These types of vehicles are inspected like any passenger vehicle.

<p>Texas considers a custom or assembled vehicle as a motorized vehicle of any kind that has been reconstructed using a body frame and a motor. A vehicle must first be registered as either class to be eligible for year of make plates to be reissued. The process of registering a car as an antique or classic in Texas requires that the owner must meet the age requirement&ndash;25 years or older&ndash;and the vehicle must be 25 years or older. Just remember to register your car in a different country once you move from Texas. This car needs to have a traditional registration to prove to the state that you have another source of transportation that will take care of your daily driving needs. Fill out and submit a custom car registration application form. Upcoming Show Alert The 7th Annual Msd Car Show El Paso Texas Flyer Car Show Flyer Template.</p>
